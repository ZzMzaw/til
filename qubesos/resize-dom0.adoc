= Resize dom0

NOTE: All these operations must be executed in a dom0 terminal

First, let's look at the current dom0 size:
```bash
df -h
# Look for /dev/mapper/qubes_dom0-root
```

Default size is 20G (at leat for Qubes 4.1).

Then, let's look at the volume group to make sure there is enough space:
```bash
sudo pvs
# Look for qubes_dom0 volume group (VG) free size
````

Last but not least, let's look at the Qubes OS root logical volume (LV):
```bash
sudo lvs /dev/qubes_dom0/root
````

It should report the same size as `df` command.

Resize the logical volume to the expected size:
```bash
sudo lvresize --size <new-size> /dev/qubes_dom0/root
```

The LV should be resized accordingly:
```bash
sudo lvs /dev/qubes_dom0/root
````

But the filesystem still remains to be resized:
```bash
df -h
# Look for /dev/mapper/qubes_dom0-root which should have the old size
```

Resize the filesystem to full extend:
```bash
sudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/qubes_dom0-root
```

Now the filesystem is resized and the space is available:
```bash
df -h
# Look for /dev/mapper/qubes_dom0-root which should have the new size
```
