= Move one repository to another

NOTE: Github and other public source code repositories have convenient features to do all of this without bothering with git (rename, transfer ownership, ...) but you have to remain within the platform.

First of all, clone the existing repository:
```bash
git clone <old-repo>
```

Set remote origin to the new repository:
```bash
git remote set-url origin <new-repo>
```

Prune the existing remote branches:
```bash
git remote prune origin
```

When done, it is possible to adapt the repo in order to:

* link:change-all-commits-author.adoc[change all commits author]
* link:rename-master-branch-to-main.adoc[rename a master branch to main]

Last but not least, make all the existing branches track branches in the new repository while pushing them:
```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
git push --set-upstream origin "<branch-name>"
```

Using prezto aliases:

```bash
# Clone old repo
gfc <old-repo>
# Set remote to the new repo
gR set-url origin <new-repo>
# Prune existing remote branches
gRp

# Do any update you want

# Track branches while pushin them
gco <branch-name>
gpc
```
