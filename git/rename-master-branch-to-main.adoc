= Rename master branch to main

NOTE: This can be applied to rename any branch

First rename the local `master` branch into `main`:
```bash
git branch -m master main
```

As branch is renamed, it is assumed only the `master` branch exists in the remote repository.

Push the new branch:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Change the default branch of the project to `main` (if not done yet when repository has been created).

If needed, delete the remote `master` branch:
```bash
git push origin --delete master
```

Using prezto aliases:

```bash
# Rename local branch
gbm master main
# Push the new branch
gco main
gpc
# Delete the old branch (once no more the default branch)
gp origin --delete master
```
